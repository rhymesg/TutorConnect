## Technical Implementation Details

### Responsive Design Strategy
- **Mobile-first**: All components start with mobile layout and scale up
- **Breakpoints**: Uses Tailwind's responsive prefixes (sm, md, lg, xl)
- **Adaptive Content**: Text sizes, button labels, and spacing adjust per device
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px touch targets for mobile accessibility
- **Grid Flexibility**: 1→2→3→4 column progression for post cards

### Performance Optimizations
- **Infinite Scroll**: Reduces initial load time and improves perceived performance
- **Image Loading**: Lazy loading with smooth transitions
- **Debounced Search**: Prevents excessive API calls during typing
- **Skeleton Loading**: Maintains layout stability during loading states
- **Component Memoization**: Ready for React.memo optimization where needed

### Accessibility Features
- **Semantic HTML**: Proper use of headings, lists, and form elements
- **ARIA Labels**: Screen reader support for all interactive elements
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support for all controls
- **Color Contrast**: WCAG AA compliant color combinations
- **Focus Management**: Visible focus indicators and logical tab order

### Norwegian Market Considerations
- **Currency Formatting**: Uses Intl.NumberFormat for NOK display
- **Regional Data**: Integration with Norwegian counties and education system
- **Language Patterns**: Norwegian-style sorting and filtering terminology
- **Cultural UX**: Familiar patterns from Finn.no and other Norwegian platforms

## API Integration Points
- `GET /api/posts` - Main posts listing with filtering and pagination
- `POST /api/chat` - Contact functionality for post interactions
- Uses existing `useApiCall` hook for consistent error handling
- URL parameter synchronization for shareable search results

## Testing Considerations
- **Responsive Testing**: Components tested across mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports
- **Loading States**: All loading scenarios properly handled
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful degradation when API calls fail
- **Performance**: Infinite scroll tested with large datasets
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard and screen reader navigation verified

## Future Enhancements
- Real-time post updates via WebSocket
- Saved searches and favorites functionality
- Map view integration for location-based browsing
- Advanced filters (availability calendar, rating ranges)
- Post analytics and view tracking
