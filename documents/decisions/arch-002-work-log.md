# ARCH-002 Work Log: API Architecture Design

**Task**: ARCH-002 - API Architecture Design  
**Agent**: tutorconnect-architect  
**Date**: 2025-08-18  
**Status**: Completed ✅

## Execution Summary

Successfully designed comprehensive REST API architecture for TutorConnect with Norwegian market focus and GDPR compliance.

## Work Completed

### 1. Database Schema Analysis ✅
- **Action**: Reviewed existing Prisma schema from ARCH-001
- **Result**: Identified all models and relationships for API design
- **Key Findings**: 
  - 9 main models (User, Post, Chat, Message, etc.)
  - Norwegian-specific enums (NorwegianRegion, Subject, AgeGroup)
  - Privacy settings for GDPR compliance
  - Proper indexing for performance

### 2. API Endpoint Specifications ✅
- **Action**: Designed complete REST API endpoint structure
- **Result**: 40+ endpoints across 7 main resource groups
- **Coverage**:
  - Authentication & Authorization (8 endpoints)
  - User Management (7 endpoints)
  - Posts Management (6 endpoints)
  - Chat & Messaging (9 endpoints)
  - Appointments (7 endpoints)
  - File Management (6 endpoints)
  - System Endpoints (5 endpoints)

### 3. Authentication & Authorization Design ✅
- **Action**: Designed JWT-based authentication system
- **Components**:
  - Registration flow with email verification
  - Login/logout with access/refresh tokens
  - Role-based access control (RBAC)
  - Resource-based authorization
- **Security Features**:
  - 15-minute access tokens
  - 7-day refresh tokens
  - Email verification requirement
  - Password strength validation

### 4. Real-time Communication Architecture ✅
- **Action**: Designed WebSocket and Supabase real-time integration
- **Components**:
  - WebSocket handler for bi-directional communication
  - Supabase real-time subscriptions for database changes
  - Event-driven architecture for chat, appointments, user status
- **Events Supported**:
  - Chat messages (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE)
  - Appointment changes (all operations)
  - User status updates (online/offline)
  - Typing indicators

### 5. Error Handling Standards ✅
- **Action**: Defined comprehensive error handling system
- **Components**:
  - Custom error classes (APIError, ValidationError, etc.)
  - Standardized error response format
  - HTTP status code mapping
  - Norwegian language error messages
- **Features**:
  - Request ID tracking
  - Error logging with context
  - Prisma/Zod error transformation
  - GDPR audit logging

### 6. Security & GDPR Compliance ✅
- **Action**: Implemented security patterns and GDPR requirements
- **Security Features**:
  - Input validation with Zod schemas
  - Rate limiting with Redis
  - CORS and security headers
  - Norwegian postal code validation
- **GDPR Features**:
  - Audit logging for data access
  - Data export endpoint
  - Privacy settings enforcement
  - Right to be forgotten implementation

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Authentication Strategy
- **Decision**: JWT tokens with refresh mechanism
- **Rationale**: Stateless, scalable, supports mobile clients
- **Alternative Considered**: Session-based auth (rejected for scalability)

### 2. Real-time Communication
- **Decision**: WebSocket + Supabase real-time
- **Rationale**: Best of both worlds - bidirectional WS + database-driven events
- **Alternative Considered**: Server-Sent Events only (insufficient for chat)

### 3. Error Handling
- **Decision**: Structured error responses with Norwegian localization
- **Rationale**: Better UX for Norwegian users, consistent API contract
- **Alternative Considered**: Generic HTTP status codes (insufficient detail)

### 4. Rate Limiting
- **Decision**: Redis-based with endpoint-specific rules
- **Rationale**: Flexible, scalable, prevents abuse
- **Alternative Considered**: In-memory rate limiting (not scalable)

### 5. Validation Strategy
- **Decision**: Zod schemas with Norwegian-specific validations
- **Rationale**: Type safety, runtime validation, localization support
- **Alternative Considered**: Joi validation (less TypeScript integration)

## Norwegian Market Considerations

### 1. Regional Support
- Complete Norwegian region enum (17 regions)
- Postal code validation (4-digit format)
- Region-based filtering and search

### 2. Language Support
- Error messages in Norwegian and English
- Accept-Language header support
- Norwegian postal code integration

### 3. GDPR Compliance
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Data portability (export endpoint)
- Privacy settings per data type
- Right to be forgotten implementation

### 4. Cultural Adaptations
- Privacy-first approach (data on-request by default)
- Transparent data processing
- User control over information sharing

## Files Created

### Primary Deliverables
1. **`/documents/decisions/ADR-003-api-architecture.md`**
   - Complete API architecture decision record
   - Endpoint specifications and authentication flows
   - Real-time communication design
   - Error handling and security patterns

2. **`/documents/decisions/API-Implementation-Specifications.md`**
   - Detailed implementation guide for developers
   - Code examples and middleware configurations
   - Norwegian-specific feature implementations
   - GDPR compliance implementation details

### Supporting Documentation
3. **`/documents/decisions/arch-002-work-log.md`** (this file)
   - Complete work execution log
   - Technical decisions and rationale
   - Norwegian market considerations

## Implementation Readiness

### Ready for Development
- Complete API endpoint specifications ✅
- Authentication flow design ✅
- Database integration patterns ✅
- Error handling standards ✅
- Security implementation guide ✅

### Next Steps for Backend Team
