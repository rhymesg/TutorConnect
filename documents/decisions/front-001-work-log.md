### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach with progressive enhancement
- Breakpoints: mobile (default), tablet (768px+), desktop (1024px+)
- Touch-friendly interaction areas (minimum 44px)
- Flexible layouts that adapt to all screen sizes
- Safe area support for devices with notches/home indicators

## Norwegian Design Language

### Visual Identity
- **Primary Color**: Norwegian sky blue (#0ea5e9) 
- **Secondary Color**: Norwegian red (#ef4444)
