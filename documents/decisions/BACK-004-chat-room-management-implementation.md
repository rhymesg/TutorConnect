# BACK-004: Chat Room Management API Implementation

## Overview

Implemented a comprehensive Chat Room Management system for TutorConnect that handles the complete lifecycle of chat rooms between tutors and students. The system provides robust API endpoints for creating, managing, searching, and analyzing chat interactions.

## Architecture Decision Records

### Core Design Decisions

1. **Existing System Enhancement**: The chat system was already partially implemented. Instead of rebuilding, enhanced the existing implementation with additional features and improved functionality.

2. **Prisma-Based Data Management**: Leveraged existing Prisma schema with Chat, ChatParticipant, and Message models. No schema changes were required.

3. **Multi-layered API Structure**: Organized APIs into logical groupings:
   - Core chat management (`/api/chat/`)
   - Advanced search (`/api/chat/search/`)
   - Analytics (`/api/chat/analytics/`, `/api/chat/stats/`)
   - Bulk operations (`/api/chat/bulk/`)
   - Real-time capabilities (`/api/chat/realtime/`)
   - Settings management (`/api/chat/settings/`)

4. **Post-Chat Integration**: Seamless integration with existing post system through `/api/posts/[postId]/chat/` for automatic chat creation when users interact with posts.
